Hi, and thanks for taking the time to view my profile. My name's Alex and I'm a freelance Data Analyst. My background is in the travel sector but I have more generic experience of fiance, hr, marketing and ecommerce

With over 25 years of experience in the travel industry and a recent transition into data analytics, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. My extensive background in the travel sector has given me a deep understanding of the industryâ€™s dynamics, while my training in data analytics allows me to extract valuable insights from complex data sets.

As a strategic thinker and practical implementer, I have a proven track record in the school travel market and tourism industry. I am self-motivated, pragmatic, and resilient, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a growth mindset. I am comfortable in both field and office environments and have a history of developing strong working relationships.

In the past year, I have focused on developing my technical skills, completing a Data Science Bootcamp at La Wagon and a course in Power BI at datacamp.com. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Numpy, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks. I have also gained practical experience as an In-Ground Data Analyst at Stats Perform, where I was responsible for data collection and analytics.

I am now seeking opportunities as a freelance consultant, where I can apply my data analytics skills to help businesses make data-driven decisions. While I am particularly interested in roles within the travel sector, I am open to opportunities in other industries as well.
